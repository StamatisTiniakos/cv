                            Currently working on a new product developing both parts of the back-end (API) and front-end
                            (UI). Main technologies used are C#, .Net framework, Javascript and React.</li>
                        <li>
                            Contributed to the development of a load testing tool which was designed to test the data
                            handling limits of the system. SQL scripting was used for creating the test data and Python
                            for processing and loading the data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Developed a recommender engine for Barrachd’s
                            main platform. Used natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (Python) and data
                            mining to develop a recommender system. The goal was to produce a proof of concept which can
                            be implemented in future iterations of the platform. The developed system produced high
                            accuracy in classifying social media posts as relevant or not relevant.
